Generative AI has opened up new creative possibilities, but most applications rely on cloud-based models, which can introduce latency, privacy, and cost challenges. In this session, we explore how to shift from server-side story generation to efficient on-device personalization. By using Google’s Gemini API and Gemma models, we demonstrate a hybrid approach that maintains quality while optimizing for responsiveness, adaptability, and user control.

Abstract:
Join us as we journey from the cloud to your pocket, using Google’s Gemini API and Gemma on-device model to refine story generation. We’ll start with cloud-based story creation and then shift to running models directly on-device, showcasing how to enhance outputs with tuning techniques. By the end, you'll see how to measure and compare the results of each stage.


What the Session Covers:
This session dives deep into the practical use of language models for story generation, moving from a Gemini model to on-device Gemma models and refining them for richer output. We'll explore the transition to on-device models that can be progressively tuned.

* Starting with a Gemini API to generate initial stories.
* Transitioning to on-device models for offline and personalized story generation.
* Demonstrating three stages of on-device model use: the base model, a prompt-tuned version, and a fine-tuned version using adapter tuning.
* Evaluation methods to compare and measure the improvements in story quality across these different models.

Session Highlights:

* Practical steps for moving from API-based generation to on-device models.
* A detailed look at how prompt tuning and fine-tuning can enhance on-device model outputs.
* Simple evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated stories.

Key Takeaways:
Attendees will gain insight into how to evolve from cloud-based to on-device models, how to refine model outputs through tuning, and how to evaluate the improvements effectively.",na,not prepared yet,No,No,Bangalore,

While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language generation, they lack the cognitive structures required for sustained reasoning and adaptive behavior. Cognitive architectures for LLM agents aim to fill this gap, offering blueprints that integrate memory, planning, reflection, and decision-making—drawing inspiration from decades of human-centered cognitive research.

This talk will introduce the core components of such architectures, including multi-level memory systems, reasoning and planning modules, reflection loops for self-correction, and action layers for tool use and real-world interaction. Building on recent advances such as CoALA, ReflAct, and the Task Memory Engine, we will explore how these designs are transforming LLMs into more capable and reliable agents.

We will also highlight emerging design patterns—from ReAct’s integration of reasoning and acting, to Reflexion’s self-critique, to PreAct’s predictive planning—while addressing the open challenges of scaling context and memory, mitigating hallucinations, defining evaluation benchmarks, and ensuring ethical, safe deployment.

By weaving together insights from cognitive science and the latest LLM research, this session paints a vision of synthetic cognition: a future where AI agents evolve from reactive tools into adaptive collaborators—capable of learning, reflecting, and co-creating alongside humans.","A cognitive architecture for LLM agents typically includes:
	• Memory systems (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic)
	• Reasoning and planning modules (patterns like ReAct, Reflexion, PreAct)
	• Perception and action layers for interacting with tools, APIs, and environments
	• Control and reflection mechanisms for error correction, alignment, and adaptive learning
Recent works such as CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents), Task Memory Engine, ReflAct, and PreAct highlight how these components can be combined into practical, robust designs.
However, key challenges remain: scaling memory, reducing hallucinations, evaluating cognitive adequacy, and ensuring alignment and safety. Despite these hurdles, cognitive architectures offer a pathway to building reliable, adaptive, and trustworthy LLM agents that move beyond token prediction toward synthetic cognition.
This talk will explore the building blocks, emerging patterns, challenges, and future directions of cognitive architectures for LLM agents, offering insights valuable to both researchers and practitioners.","1. https://arxiv.org/html/2309.02427v3

You’ll get practical guidance on agent identity and least-privilege authorization, encrypted A2A messaging, safe delegation of scanning tasks, and tamper-evident reporting. Live demos will cover integrating agents into pipelines, handling false positives, and building an audit trail so scans are both automated and trustworthy.

This talk is practical and hands-on, focusing on real-world backend challenges.

2. Includes live examples and case studies from production systems.

3. This is ideal for backend developers, full-stack engineers, and anyone interested in building high-performance applications.

4. Combines application scaling and database optimisation, a topic not commonly covered at DevFest, making it unique and valuable to the developer community.","These slides is just a part of talk which I gave recently. It will have more content aligning to my talk
