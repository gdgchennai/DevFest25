			"Context and Background\nGenerative AI has opened up new creative possibilities, but most applications rely on cloud-based models, which can introduce latency, privacy, and cost challenges. In this session, we explore how to shift from server-side story generation to efficient on-device personalization. By using Google's Gemini API and Gemma models, we demonstrate a hybrid approach that maintains quality while optimizing for responsiveness, adaptability, and user control.\n\nAbstract:\nJoin us as we journey from the cloud to your pocket, using Google's Gemini API and Gemma on-device model to refine story generation. We'll start with cloud-based story creation and then shift to running models directly on-device, showcasing how to enhance outputs with tuning techniques. By the end, you'll see how to measure and compare the results of each stage.\n\nWhat the Session Covers:\nThis session dives deep into the practical use of language models for story generation, moving from a Gemini model to on-device Gemma models and refining them for richer output. We'll explore the transition to on-device models that can be progressively tuned.\n\nâ€¢ Starting with a Gemini API to generate initial stories.\nâ€¢ Transitioning to on-device models for offline and personalized story generation.\nâ€¢ Demonstrating three stages of on-device model use: the base model, a prompt-tuned version, and a fine-tuned version using adapter tuning.\nâ€¢ Evaluation methods to compare and measure the improvements in story quality across these different models.\n\nSession Highlights:\nâ€¢ Practical steps for moving from API-based generation to on-device models.\nâ€¢ A detailed look at how prompt tuning and fine-tuning can enhance on-device model outputs.\nâ€¢ Simple evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated stories.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nAttendees will gain insight into how to evolve from cloud-based to on-device models, how to refine model outputs through tuning, and how to evaluate the improvements effectively.",

In agentic AI applications, memory enables systems to learn from past interactions, adapt to new contexts, and plan strategicallyâ€”much like humans do. This talk explores how different types of memory (short-term, long-term, and procedural) are shaping the next generation of AI agents, the challenges of scaling and managing memory, and the opportunities it unlocks for creating more reliable, personalized, and context-aware AI.',

		description:
			'Exploring cognitive architectures and their implementation in large language model systems',
		type: 'lightning',
		duration: 20,
		startTime: '15:45',
		endTime: '16:10',
		abstract:
			"As organizations embrace AI agents, a pressing question emerges: How can we design systems that reliably think, remember, and act over time? While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language generation, they lack the cognitive structures required for sustained reasoning and adaptive behavior. Cognitive architectures for LLM agents aim to fill this gap, offering blueprints that integrate memory, planning, reflection, and decision-makingâ€”drawing inspiration from decades of human-centered cognitive research.\n\nThis talk will introduce the core components of such architectures, including multi-level memory systems, reasoning and planning modules, reflection loops for self-correction, and action layers for tool use and real-world interaction. Building on recent advances such as CoALA, ReflAct, and the Task Memory Engine, we will explore how these designs are transforming LLMs into more capable and reliable agents.\n\nWe will also highlight emerging design patternsâ€”from ReAct's integration of reasoning and acting, to Reflexion's self-critique, to PreAct's predictive planningâ€”while addressing the open challenges of scaling context and memory, mitigating hallucinations, defining evaluation benchmarks, and ensuring ethical, safe deployment.\n\nBy weaving together insights from cognitive science and the latest LLM research, this session paints a vision of synthetic cognition: a future where AI agents evolve from reactive tools into adaptive collaboratorsâ€”capable of learning, reflecting, and co-creating alongside humans.",
